# JokerWar Intro

​JokerWar is an NFT Cards Collecting Game at the Binance Smart Chain. The core gameplay of JokerWar is to collect a set of 52 playing cards, evolve into the Joker NFT, and eventually win the jackpot. Players collect playing cards and “Synthesize” them into new ones. A collection of all playing cards gives you a key to the treasury. When the jackpot is won by a player, the new season starts.
