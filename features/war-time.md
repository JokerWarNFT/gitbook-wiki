# War Period

â€‹When a Red joker appears in the season, the player can become a Starter and start a joker war, the War Period starts and lasts at least 8 hours. The Starter gets paid for this service, of course. All other Red jokers can participate in the war, every new Red joker, the War Period increases by 4 hours. At the end of War Period, the war ends and the Red joker can share the jackpot.

Be aware that **there may exist more than one winner of a season**.
