# Cards Upgrade

The Basic cards can be synthesized to new higher level cards. 

Cards of J, Q, K, A can only be upgraded step by step. For example, a Q can only be combined by two Js, and a K can only be combined by two Qs. 

For 2~10, the number of the newly synthesized card is the sum of the number of the two cards involved in the synthesis, with random suit  and the same probability. For example, 2 and 8 can only be synthesized in 10, while 2 and 9 cannot be synthesized.
