# Training Center

Jokers can train in the Training Center by taking on four different challenges and receiving random rewards for successful challenges. Each Training Round generates four random qualification cards that must be included in the current Training Round for Jokers to be eligible to train in the Training Center. A Training Round will last for a number of cycles. There are four different levels of difficulty in the Training Centre, the higher the difficulty, the higher the reward for victory.&#x20;

There is a limit of one challenge per cycle and a maximum of three challenges in a day (24 hours).
