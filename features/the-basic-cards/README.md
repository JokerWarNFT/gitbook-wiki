# The Basic Cards

​The Basic Cards are a standard 52-card deck comprises 52 Cards in each of the 4 suits of Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. The cards are divided into 6 different levels except 2. A level only shows how difficult the particular card is to get. There are:

| Level | Card | Probability |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1** | 3 | 3/8 |
| **2** | 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 | 1/32 |
| **3** | J | 1/64 |
| **4** | Q | 1/128 |
| **5** | K | 1/256 |
| **6** | A | 1/512 |

​Once the player has collected at least one card of each type, he can transform them all into the Red Joker to win the jackpot. Each time a card is created, it receives a unique incremental serial number for this kind of card, making this token a unique NFT. 

When a card is used \(synthesized or transformed\), this NFT is burned forever.
