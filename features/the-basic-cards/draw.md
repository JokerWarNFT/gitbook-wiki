# Draw

â€‹Players can cost several JOKs \(one unit\) to draw 4 basic cards at random. There are 52 different basic cards, grouped into 6 levels. A level only shows how difficult the particular card is to get. There are:

| Level | Card | Probability |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1** | 3 | 3/8 |
| **2** | 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 | 1/32 |
| **3** | J | 1/64 |
| **4** | Q | 1/128 |
| **5** | K | 1/256 |
| **6** | A | 1/512 |

Usually, the value of a card is determined by its level \(highest best\).

The basic cards are free to be used, sold, exchanged, etc.
