The process of transforming Basic Cards into the Joker is called "**Transform**".

If all 52 cards are collected, they can be transformed into the **Red Joker,** if not, they can only be transformed into the **Black Joker**.

Players can customize the name of your Jokers.

The basic attributes of the Joker War Character \(JWC\) include Name, Creator, Evolution, Birth, JokerWar Period, and Cards.
