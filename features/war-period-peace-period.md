# War Period, Peace Period

## War Period

â€‹In a new season, players could use an unused Red Joker to start the war. The first Red Joker to join the Joker War and start it will be the War Starter. The **War Period** starts immediately and lasts for a minimum of 8 hours. The War Starter gets paid for this service, of course.&#x20;

Red Jokers who participate in the Joker War during the season can share the jackpot together. It is important to note that a maximum of five Red Jokers are allowed to join the war in a season. Once the fifth Red Joker joins the war, other Red Jokers will not be able to continue to join during this season. Whenever a new Red Joker joins the war, the War Period will increase by 8 hours.

Be aware that during the War Period, you may continue to draw basic cards.
