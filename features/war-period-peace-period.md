# War Period, Peace Period

## War Period

â€‹When a Red joker appears in the season, players who own a Red Joker and have not participated in Joker War can become a Starter to start the war. The war period starts immediately and lasts for a minimum of 8 hours. The Starter gets paid for this service, of course. All other Red jokers can participate in the war, however, only up to 5 Red Jokers are allowed to participate. Every new Red joker, the War Period increases by 8 hours. At the end of War Period, the war ends and the Red joker can share the jackpot.

Be aware that during the War Period, you may continue to draw basic cards.

## Peace Period

After the end of JokerWar, it needs to cool down for a period before a new War Period.
