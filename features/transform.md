# Transform

â€‹The process of transforming Basic Cards into Joker is called "Transform". 

If all 52 cards are collected, they are transformed into a **Red Joker**, if not, they are transformed into a **Black Joker**.

Each Joker has a Meanness Index \(MI\), which is the sum of the tokens of all the cards that participated in the transform. When the pool is finally divided, it is distributed according to the percentage of the Meanness Index. 

The process of Joker transform can be done at any time, and the earlier it is done, the better the final Joker MI will be. It can be calculated based on the card number, the older the card the lower the Joker's Evil Index MI will be, and the more bonuses will be divided.

Players can add names to their transformed joker.
