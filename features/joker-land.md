# Joker Land

The Joker Land is an Amusement Park, where eligible Jokers can work to earn.&#x20;

Each Working Round generates four random qualifying cards that must be included in the current Working Round for Jokers to be eligible to work in Joker Land. A Working Round will last for several cycles. Jokers who are eligible to work need to stake to The Joker Land in order to earn, and while staking, Jokers cannot participate in other activities and need to unstake if they want to participate in other activities such as Joker War or Training Center.&#x20;

Jokers should at least work on Joker Land for 8 Hours before unstaking.
