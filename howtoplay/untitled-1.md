# üÉè How To Win The Jackpot

JokerWar has a jackpot and keeps growing their value within the game season. To become a winning player and share the jackpot, there are the following steps:

#### Step 1: Draw The Basic Cards

Generals grow up from soldiers, and so do the Jokers. To own Joker, players must first purchase the Basic Cards.

Players can buy four basic cards of the lowest rank at a time, and also have a certain probability to obtain cards of higher rank.

#### Step 2: Synthesize The Higher Level Cards

The Higher Level Cards have a higher value. Players need to collect 52 different basic cards with 6 levels. Using lower level cards to synthesize higher level cards is an economical strategy to win.

#### Step 3: Transform The Basic Cards Into the Joker‚Äã
