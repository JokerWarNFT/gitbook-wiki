# üÉè How To Win The Jackpot

JokerWar has a jackpot and keeps growing their value within the game season. To become a winning player and share the jackpot, there are the following steps:

#### Step 1: Draw The Basic Cards

Generals grow up from soldiers, and so do the Jokers. To own Joker, players must first purchase the Basic Cards.

Players can buy four basic cards of the lowest rank at a time, and also have a certain probability to obtain cards of higher rank.

The instructions to draw the Basic cards can be found here:

#### Step 2: Synthesize The Higher Level Cards

The Higher Level Cards have a higher value. Players need to collect 52 different basic cards with 6 levels. Using lower level cards to synthesize higher level cards is an economical strategy to win.

#### Step 3: Transform The Basic Cards Into the Joker‚Äã

When you have collected some basic cards, you can transform them into a Black Joker. As you continue to synthesize new high-level basic cards, you can transform them with a Black Joker until you have transformed 52 different basic cards and you have gained a Red Joker.

Be aware that Black Joker can also play to earn in Joker War.

#### Step 4: Start the JokerWar, Win the jackpot

If you are the first Red Joker to appear during the season, you can become a Starter and start the War Period. You can win  more jackpot!

Players who have collected Red Joker in the current season can share the jackpot together. It is important to note that once five players in the current season have won Red Joker first, the rest of the players will need to go on to the next new season to transform basic cards into Red Joker to win the jackpot.
